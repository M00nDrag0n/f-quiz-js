      <h2>Dark Days Are Ahead</h2>
      <p>According to my sources, your life path is descending in a direction that will cause bad luck and misfortune for the rest of your days. Perhaps you have been cursed, or you just had a <strong>really</strong> bad week. Try these methods to reverse your bad luck:</p>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="result" id="lucky">
      <h2>Wow! I'm Impressed!</h2>
      <p>Your luck is plentiful! Here's what you can do to prevent that from changing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="result" id="neutral">
      <h2>Your Path Is Still Unclear.</h2>
      <p>According to my sources, nothing has happened. Nothing will happen. You are floating in a void and must be retrieved from the plane of ultimate neutrality. Good luck!</p>
